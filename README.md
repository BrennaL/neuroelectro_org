This is the public github repository for the NeuroElectro project.

Currently this repository encapsulates all features of the project, including text-mining (located in the folder labelled "code"), the models specifying the relational database (implemented in Django), and the website front end and back end code (implemented in Python's Django web framework).

We are currently in the process of disentangling the text-mining and database/web framework parts of the code base.
