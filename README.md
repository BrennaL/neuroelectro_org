The NeuroElectro Project: Text-mining electrophysiological data about neurons.  

The project can be explored at http://neuroelectro.org

Currently, our complete codebase is managed on BitBucket.  For security reasons we are currently separating web development code from scientific project code, with the latter to be deployed publicly under an open source license at http://github.com/neuroelectro/neuroelectro when this is complete.  In the meantime, interested collaborators and contributors should contact @rgerkin or @stripathy, or the email addresses shown on http://neuroelectro.org.
